# Progression Overhaul - "Grind Must Go On"

The main idea is to make a completely new progression flow for Anomaly and anomaly-based modpacks. The key difference is that
a new flow will require doing different activities (all of them, not one or two) to earn their specific "resources" and "rating".

Example activities:
- Killing stalkers (looting patches)
- Killing mutants (looting their stuff)
- Artifact hunting
- Questing
- Stash looting (under question, it's boring, quite unrewarding and become even less)
- Scavenging (maybe make looting stashes more rewarding)

NB "realism" is ignored completely. Just pure gameplay.

## Activities
Doing activities means gathering corresponding items or increasing statistics and turning items in for "resources" and additional "rating".

## Progression flow
Weapons and outfits are divided into N tiers, based on their price + some overrides based on efficiency. Player CAN NOT equip something, that
belongs to locked tiers. This is to make sure, that dropped gear cannot be reused without forcing it to despawn.

Next part is fairly simple: spend "resources" on specific equipment unlocks (tier-based prices) and achieve specific "rating" breakpoint to
unlock next tier. More conditions on tier unlocking can be added. (bounties, quests, etc.) Outfit enhancement (Black Desert Online) system
seems suitable and possible too.

Also, maybe there is the way to implement different tiers for "resources", to force player grind new locations.

## Progression motivators
- Most locations are "locked" behind a specific outfit tiers. Maybe the Brain Scorcher system will be reused.
- Additional locking mechanisms can be provided through player stat-checks. (e.g. rad/chem protections)
- In GAMMA, t3 toolkits are locked behind Brain Scorcher deactivation (Radar). t2 toolkit crafting recipe can be removed too.
- To "beat" the game player needs to reach CNPP+ at least. This location can require exo+ tier.
