## Current problems/bugs/etc
### RVR Storage System
FRs:
- HideoutFurniture integrations. Especially, workbenches.
- QoL interface improvements:
    - Categories selectors.
    - Search.
    - Custom amount textbox.
    - Remove stash button.
    - Exit button?
    - Deposit all button. (by category)
    - Integration with favorite/trash marks mod. To deposit trash, for example.
    - Hover on previews, if possible.
- Banking/delivery. (needs market research, lol)

Bugs:
- Armor/Weapon upgrades are being removed. Needs to be stored somewhere
- Weapon spawns loaded, seems easy to fix
