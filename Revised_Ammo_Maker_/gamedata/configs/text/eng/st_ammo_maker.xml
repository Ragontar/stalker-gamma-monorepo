		<text>Propellant, small rifle</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_powder_rifle_desc">
		<text>IMR propellant for light rifle catridges and some heavy handgun cartridges. This powder burns at a medium rate and produces a good amount of energy. Cannot be used in blowback handguns and shotguns as insufficient pressures will lead to incomplete burning, causing fouling.</text>

	<string id="st_handgun_ap_rounds_desc">
		<text>Variously sized handgun rounds salvaged from ammunition. These have alloy penetrators embedded in the bullet.
