;; This file is part of Revised Ammo Maker

;; Ammunition sections are declared in following files:
#include "ammo_*.ltx"

;; These are used as means to balance the salvage ratios to your liking.
;; Declaration of ammunition sections is optional, as
;; the script uses following values by default:

;[defaults]
;salvage_rate = 1.0	; result will never exceed highest possible count
;degradation = 0.003	; rate for tool per salvage

;; ammunition sections are still declared as before
;;  parts = values are ignored and read from the recipe
;[ammo_357_hp_mag]
;salvage_rate = 0.75
;[ammo_357_hp_mag_bad]:ammo_357_hp_mag
